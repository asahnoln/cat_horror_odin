## Ideas

Horror game about cat.

Cat runs towards a goal (to eat maybe) and then returns home (to its main hiding spot).

Cat owners are enemies who wants to cuddle the cat.

### Events

- [ ] Castration: we must save our balls
- [ ] Disensection: danger zones?
- [ ] Guests: children!
- [ ] If you do enough damage (storywise or somehow else?) to one owner, he gives you to other owner with different set of rules

### Characters

- [ ] Different owners - 1 cuddles, 2 takes to castration
- [ ] Owners might allow or prohibit different zones for the cat

### Locations

- [ ] Mouse shop for the cat?
- [ ] Cat tray (a goal connected to it?)
